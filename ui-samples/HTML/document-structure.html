<!-- 
    Doctype HTML is a declaration that tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in.
    This declaration appears as the very first line in an HTML file.
    The HTML <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML element or tag.
    It is an instruction that tells the browser what type of document to expect.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">

      <!-- It contains an article -->
      <article>
        <h2>Article heading</h2>

        <p>
          Main Content - A big area in the center that contains most of the unique
          content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch,
          or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc.
          This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page.
        </p>

        <h3>Subsection</h3>

        <p>
          Side Bar - Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually,
          this is contextual to what is contained in the main content
          (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio,
          or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring
          elements like a secondary navigation system.
        </p>

        <h3>Another subsection</h3>

        <p>
          Footer - A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print,
          copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header)
          but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself.
          The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links
          for quick access to popular content.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- the aside content can also be nested within the main content -->
      <aside>
        <h2>Related</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Oh I do like to be beside the seaside</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Oh I do like to be beside the sea</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Although in the North of England</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">It never stops raining</a></li>
        </ul>
